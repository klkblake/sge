sge - Simple Game Engine
========================

sge is a simple 3D game engine for Go. It uses Go-OpenGL and Atom's
Go-SDL fork. Currently, the main version of Go-OpenGL does not support
all the functions we need, so you will need to use the one at
https://github.com/Agon/Go-OpenGL.

For an example of how to use this library, check the example directory.
It should be fairly straightforward.
